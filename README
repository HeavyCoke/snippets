They may be useful for you too...

Old style 'table' of contents:

+ algorithms
|
+-- custom_sort.py - sort by any object property using lambda functions
|
+ audio
|
+-- generate_noise_test_python - create a wav file with 300 seconds of noise in python
|
+-- wav2ogg - encode all .wav files in current directory to .ogg
|
+ utils
|
+-- image_convert - image conversions. Currently only png2jpg, more to come I guess...
|
+-- screenshots - take periodical screenshots of your desktop
|
+-- screencast2 - making desktop screencasts in Ubuntu. Capture both screen AND PulseAudio. No Jack!
+ web
|
+-- fix_entities - converts (some) html entities to its UTF8 counterparts
|
+-- unicode_table - builds a unicode table so that you can see what available signs are there. Useful for creating silly smileys in Twitter et al.
